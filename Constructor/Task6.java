// 6. Static Factory Method:
//    Create a 'Time' class with fields 'hour' and 'minute'. Implement a private constructor and a static factory method 'of' that takes 'hour' and 'minute' as parameters and returns a new 'Time' object. The factory method should validate that the 'hour' is between 0 and 23 and the 'minute' is between 0 and 59.
