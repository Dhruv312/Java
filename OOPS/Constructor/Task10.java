// 10. Mutability and Immutability:
//     Create an immutable 'Point' class with fields 'x' and 'y'. Implement a constructor to initialize these fields and do not provide any setter methods. Ensure that the fields are private and final, and write methods to get the values of 'x' and 'y'.

    private int y;
